# F1-Sponsorship-Insights - Identifying Top Teams and Rising Drivers (2021‚Äì2024)
A data-driven exploration of Formula 1 performance between 2021‚Äì2024 ‚Äî uncovering which teams deliver the strongest brand exposure and which young drivers show championship-level potential.

**Data Cleaning Notes :**
The available data has NULLS across the board prior to 2021.
So, all records prior to 2021 are deleted on Excel, manually.
All rows with "\N" are replaced with "" for use on Google Big Query.
No other cleaning is necessary.
<br><br>

## Option 1 - High budget option

**‚ÄúWhich F1 team delivers the greatest sponsorship visibility and performance worldwide to maximize our brand‚Äôs exposure and prestige?‚Äù**

Basically, we need to identify which team who scored the highest between 2021 and 2024 season.
<br><br>

<h3>üèéÔ∏è Data / Tables Used</h3>
<p><em>(These three need to be joined to create the full dataset.)</em></p>

The tables can be downloaded here :

[tables.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23136327/tables.zip)
<br><br>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>File Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>constructors.csv</b></td>
    <td>Contains F1 team names and references</td>
    <td>Defines <b>who</b> the team is</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>results.csv</b></td>
    <td>Summarizes race event outcomes (positions, points, etc.)</td>
    <td>Explains <b>what happened</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>races.csv</b></td>
    <td>Lists each race event with date and location</td>
    <td>Identifies <b>when and where</b> it happened</td>

<br><br>

The SQL code to join the tables :

[sql - table joins.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23136300/sql.-.table.joins.zip)
<br><br>

The resulting table is called "f1data".

<br><br>

The SQL code to find the top 3 scorer between year 2021 - 2024:

Between 2021 and 2024, Red Bull clearly dominated the Formula 1 field, earning 2,711 total points, far ahead of Mercedes (1,949) and Ferrari (1,794). The large margin highlights Red Bull‚Äôs consistent top finishes and superior performance across seasons. Mercedes and Ferrari remained competitive but were unable to match Red Bull‚Äôs pace or reliability over the four-year span.

## Conclusion : 
If the budget is high, sponsor the Red Bull team for maximum brand exposure and performance across all key metrics.
<br><br><br>

## Option 2 - Low budget option

**‚ÄúWhich Emerging F1 Drivers Represent the Next Generation of Champions ‚Äî and Smart Early-Stage Sponsorship Opportunities?‚Äù**


Identify young drivers who are rapidly improving, consistently scoring higher, and outperforming their machinery ‚Äî the kind of affordable, high-upside talent a brand could back before they become global stars.
<br><br>

**Data Cleaning Notes :**

- two columns are deleted manually in excel, they are "number" and "code", because they dont serve any purpose and are mostly contains '\N' anyway.
- In "dob" column, a few rows of data is ##########. I converted them to ''. Also done manually in excel before I brought them to Big Query.

Next, we are going to use the "drivers" table to create another table out of it for future reference. We call this new table "young_drivers", and we only include drivers who by the end of 2024 season is 25 years of age at the maximum.
<br><br>

The SQL Query to process **"drivers"** table and make **"young_drivers"** table :
<br>
[sql - young drivers.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23136790/sql.-.young.drivers.zip)
<br><br>

Here is the result :
<br>
<img width="835" height="266" alt="query_result_02 - drivers under 25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2ec70bc-ab04-4613-ba9b-d708449cef75" />

There are only 7 drivers who by the end of 2024 season is 25 years of age at the maximum. 
<br><br>

For the following process, we need to join these four tables:

<img width="800" height="512" alt="tables2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dffcda1d-766f-447b-bc8d-3be774ee7187" />
<br><br>

The SQL Query to process the 4 tables :
<br>
[sql - four tables.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23136935/sql.-.four.tables.zip)
<br><br>

The resulting table, **"young_drivers"** table ( replacing the previous table ) :
<br>
<img width="142" height="321" alt="tbl_young_drivers_results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60a1b8b4-95ca-42bc-aaa9-8297f4bba4fe" />
<br><br>
Now that we have this table, we can figure out the criteria we need to use to determine which young drivers are the most promising ones by answering these questions :
- Do they have performance consistency in total?
- Can we see their performance improvements over time?
<br><br>

## Young driver's performance consistency :
<br><br>

Interpretation:
A driver who consistently finishes in the top 5‚Äì10, not just once in a while, is likely to keep improving ‚Äî and ensures your brand gets seen regularly. This can be seen by the number of total points they score.
