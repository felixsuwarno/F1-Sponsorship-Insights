# F1-Sponsorship-Insights - Identifying Top Teams and Rising Drivers (2021‚Äì2024)
A data-driven exploration of Formula 1 performance between 2021‚Äì2024 ‚Äî uncovering which teams deliver the strongest brand exposure and which young drivers show championship-level potential.

**Data Cleaning Notes :**
The available data has NULLS across the board prior to 2021.
So, all records prior to 2021 are deleted on Excel, manually.
All rows with "\N" are replaced with "" for use on Google Big Query.
No other cleaning is necessary.
<br><br>

## Option 1 - High budget option

**‚ÄúWhich F1 team delivers the greatest sponsorship visibility and performance worldwide to maximize our brand‚Äôs exposure and prestige?‚Äù**

Basically, we need to identify which team who scored the highest between 2021 and 2024 season.
<br><br>

<h3>üèéÔ∏è Data / Tables Used</h3>
<p><em>(These three need to be joined to create the full dataset.)</em></p>

The tables can be downloaded here :

[tables.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23136327/tables.zip)
<br><br>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>File Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>constructors.csv</b></td>
    <td>Contains F1 team names and references</td>
    <td>Defines <b>who</b> the team is</td>

The SQL code to join the tables :

[sql - table joins.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23136300/sql.-.table.joins.zip)
<br><br>

The resulting table is called "f1data".

Between 2021 and 2024, Red Bull clearly dominated the Formula 1 field, earning 2,711 total points, far ahead of Mercedes (1,949) and Ferrari (1,794). The large margin highlights Red Bull‚Äôs consistent top finishes and superior performance across seasons. Mercedes and Ferrari remained competitive but were unable to match Red Bull‚Äôs pace or reliability over the four-year span.

## Conclusion : 
If the budget is high, sponsor the Red Bull team for maximum brand exposure and performance across all key metrics.
<br><br><br>

## Option 2 - Low budget option

**‚ÄúWhich Emerging F1 Drivers Represent the Next Generation of Champions ‚Äî and Smart Early-Stage Sponsorship Opportunities?‚Äù**


A driver with a combined score significantly higher than others would be a promising young talent ‚Äî a potential future champion.
<br><br>

Next, we are going to use the "drivers" table to create another table out of it for future reference. We call this new table "young_drivers", and we only include drivers who by the end of 2024 season is 25 years of age at the maximum.
<br><br>

**Data Cleaning Notes :**

- two columns are deleted manually in excel, they are "number" and "code", because they dont serve any purpose and are mostly contains '\N' anyway.
- In "dob" column, a few rows of data is ##########. I converted them to ''. Also done manually in excel before I brought them to Big Query.

The SQL Query to process **"drivers"** table and make **"young_drivers"** table :
<br>
[sql - young drivers.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23136790/sql.-.young.drivers.zip)
<br><br>

Here is the result :
<br>
<img width="835" height="266" alt="query_result_02 - drivers under 25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2ec70bc-ab04-4613-ba9b-d708449cef75" />

There are only 7 drivers who by the end of 2024 season is 25 years of age at the maximum. 
<br><br>

For the following process, we need to join these four tables:

<img width="800" height="512" alt="tables2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dffcda1d-766f-447b-bc8d-3be774ee7187" />
<br><br>

The 4 csv tables
<br>
[tables - all four.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23142016/tables.-.all.four.zip)
<br><br>

The SQL Query to join the 4 tables :
<br>
[sql - four tables.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23136935/sql.-.four.tables.zip)
<br><br>

The resulting table, **"young_drivers"** table ( replacing the previous table ) :
<br>
<img width="142" height="321" alt="tbl_young_drivers_results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60a1b8b4-95ca-42bc-aaa9-8297f4bba4fe" />
<br><br>
Now that we have this table, we can figure out the criteria we need to use to determine which young drivers are the most promising ones by answering these questions :
- Do they have good performance in the past 4 years / between 2021 - 2024 ?
- Can we see their performance improvements over time?
<br><br>

## Young driver's performance between 2021 - 2024 :
<br>
Interpretation:
A driver who consistently finishes in the top 5‚Äì10, not just once in a while, is likely to keep improving ‚Äî and ensures your brand gets seen regularly. This can be seen by the number of total points they score.
<br><br>

The SQL Query to extract performance information from **young_drivers_result** table :<br>
[sql - young_drivers_performance.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23143603/sql.-.young_drivers_performance.zip)
<br><br>

The CSV file :<br>
[table - young_drivers_performance.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23143934/table.-.young_drivers_performance.zip)
<br><br>

<img width="976" height="271" alt="tbl_young_drivers_performance" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c984f01-c10f-49d3-9a0a-6b3e62ff3ad2" />
<br><br>

**Total Points**       
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The larger the value, the better the performance.
	
**Fastest Laps counter**        
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everytime a racer managed to do the fastest lap in any race ( meaning the rank is 1, a score of 1 is added.
	
**Average Rank**                    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a driver is not achieving fastest lap, he is still ranked. This is his average rank. Lower number is better.
<br><br>

Based on this result alone, Oscar Piastri appears to be the most promising young racer. By the end of 2024, he was 23 years old, and his total score was significantly higher than that of the second-place driver, Yuki Tsunoda. Piastri achieved three fastest laps across four seasons, and his overall ranking surpassed the rest ‚Äî making him the clear standout.
<br>

However, this result alone doesn‚Äôt reveal how a driver‚Äôs performance has changed over time. To understand that, we need to dig deeper ‚Äî does the driver‚Äôs performance improve, decline, or level off over the seasons? We would not want to sponsor Oscar Piastri if his performance actually went down.
