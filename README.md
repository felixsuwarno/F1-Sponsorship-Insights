# F1-Sponsorship-Insights - Identifying Top Teams and Rising Drivers (2021‚Äì2024)
A data-driven exploration of Formula 1 performance between 2021‚Äì2024 ‚Äî uncovering which teams deliver the strongest brand exposure and which young drivers show championship-level potential.

**Data Cleaning Notes :**
The available data has NULLS across the board prior to 2021.
So, all records prior to 2021 are deleted on Excel, manually.
All rows with "\N" are replaced with "" for use on Google Big Query.
No other cleaning is necessary.
